tldr; how do I wipe the memory (spi flash?) on a Feather M0.
I'm using a Adafruit Feather M0 WiFi with ATWINC1500 and the Wifi101 library. I've used the provisioning example to connect to it as an AP and then enter my SSID/pwd. That's all working fine but I'd like to be able to clear the SSID/pwd from the device so I can test more easily. I tried to use the Adafruit SPI Flash Total Erase but get the error "Error, failed to initialize flash chip!". Am I on the right path or should I be trying something else? Thanks!

ATSAMD21  + ATWINC1500
The wifi chip is an SPI peripheral; this is an ordinary SAMD21 (G18A) target board with a WiFi peripheral soldered onto it
@brianwhite I'm guessing the WINC1500 may have a small storage area in it, so to erase that you'd be talking over the SPI bus, from the SAMD21 chip (SAMD doin the talkin)
So you wanna learn the API that talks the language the WINCE chip understands.

Reading the schematic it became obvious what the attached storage was (no storage peripheral chip on this target board) and what the protocol was (SPI) to talk to the WINCE chip.
This page is going to say the basics of talking to the wifi chip:

Maybe the WINCE datasheet can shed some light on why this flash code is present in the repo. ;)
(The market may have a target board with external SPI flashROM.  Not sure it makes sense to think of the WINCE chip as having an 'internal' spi flashROM.)
Could very well be that while the Adafruit vended target has no external spi flashROM, some other vendor's work does.  I don't know. ;)

Good place to dig for background. ;)
@brianwhite looks bingo-ish to me:

https://github.com/arduino-libraries/WiFi101/blob/master/src/driver/include/m2m_wifi.h#L744
and I'm back quiet.
